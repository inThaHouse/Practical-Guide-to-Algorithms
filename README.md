  <summary>Space & Time Complexity</summary>

- Time complexity: How we reason about the speed of an algorythm. How many primitive operations are executed.
- Space complexity: How much memory is used.
- An example of constant time operation; O(1), arr.pop; arr.push, a property look up operation
- A `for` loop is a linear operation.
- Comparing all numbers to one another, we call this `n^2` operations.
